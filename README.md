This assignment was meant as practice in our use of Test-Driven Development. This was definitely the greatest challenge for me, and a skill I will continue to practice. 
It forced me to be more intentional about implementing single-responsibility-principle, as well as writing more pure functions. 
I am happy with the current pub-sub pattern to communicate between functions handling display and functions that handle information, so that is something I will keep using in the future. 
I use factory functions throughout the game, and I find them easy to read/understand, and a good pattern to allow functions to access methods. I would like to play with constructor functions & classes in the future, but from past experience factory functions are simple & accessible.
